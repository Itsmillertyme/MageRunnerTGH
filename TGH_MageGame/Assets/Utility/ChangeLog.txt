Created my sandbox.
Changed code for what spell ui displays.
Updated Game Events for spells 4-6.
Added projectiles for spells 3,4,6. These are mainly placeholders.
Added enum for spawn method. Will utilize later.
Added the logic to update projectile size. Will utilize later. After doing that there will only be one prefab per spell.
Locked spell 5. I have to figure out how to do this one still.

Added textures and materials for spells 2 and 3. Adjusted material and trail renderer values for 1-3.
Modified the devbreak code. It now pauses time rather than the editor. It also unpauses. This way we can skip frame by frame. 
Something happened to the reticle again.

10/1 - Cory
Added clamp on z for mouse position tracker. removed clamp from spellbook.
Reworked spellbooks to have enums for each spell.
Removed the prefabbed levels of spells. Now the scale is changed per level and we use one prefab. 
Using the enum, we can now dictate the spawn method per spell. 
Set up the spawn logic and added to most spells.
There's an issue with flamethrower going the wrong way when casted too soon. it's projectile mover script related. 
Reorganized the spell folders.
Remade the fireball shader material setup to use the same style as ray. 1 less mat, plus less transparent.
Updated all spell values besides earth shards.
For all spells that spawn with an offset, removed the parent "base point" empties. With the new spawn system, we no longer need an intermediate party.
Damage now works for all spells besides earth shards. Earth shards has not been worked on yet. 
Temporarily commented out the player damage stuff from the script.
